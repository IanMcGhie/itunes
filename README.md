Node Xmms remote control 

Here's a story....

One day, one of the audio outputs quit on my laptop.  This really wasn't a big
deal. I had another computer right beside my laptop.  I plugged my stereo amplifier
(QSC MX1500a) into the other computer & away I went....sort of.

I've been using winamp, or xmms with a winamp skin, since I discovered napster. I 
really have all those winamp shortcut keys etched into memory. Alt-tab b, Alt-tab c, 
Alt-tab....you get the idea, all this alt-tab task switching...

After six months of pressing alt-tab on the wrong keyboard, I snapped. Thats when Chris said,

	'You need node....express...& websockets'

I had no idea what he was talking about....

...

After some kicking & screaming, I got that working in firefox & could control winamp remotely.

But they say,

	"Any program, when running, is obsolete."

One day I was in the kitchen & thought, 

	"It would be nice if I could control my stereo from the kitchen somehow". 

I looked at my phone, a blackberry curve 9360 from 2011 & said,

 	"If only this phone had firefo...", and A chill ran down my spine.

I like my phone....its a cell phone...it rings...it beeps, the battery lasts for 
days (thats days people, DAYS!). It has text messages. I think it is the only cell phone I've
ever used actually. I also have an Android phone, but I don't use that for phone calls & only
carry that when I have to.
 
All this asynchronous application development that's been happening for the last decade my 
phone couldn't handle & I had to start over.

...& over

...& over one more time

Now I can control & listen to my stereo from the internet.

Perfect...no,
